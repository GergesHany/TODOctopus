# TODOctopus 🐙

TODOctopus is a fun and interactive todo list website where tasks are represented as octopus tentacles. Each task added corresponds to one of the octopus's eight arms. Upon adding the ninth task, a new octopus is spawned.

Your mission is to complete your tasks in order to defeat these octopuses. As you complete tasks, tentacles are chopped off from the octopuses, and when the last tentacle is chopped, you've successfully defeated the octopus. 👏🏻
